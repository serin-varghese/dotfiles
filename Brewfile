# Brewfile - Homebrew Bundle
# Install all packages with: brew bundle
# Generate from current system: brew bundle dump

# Taps
# Note: Explicitly tapping `homebrew/bundle`, `homebrew/cask`, and
# `homebrew/core` is no longer required and can cause errors. Homebrew
# provides bundle and cask functionality from core now. If you run into
# a package that requires an additional tap, add it individually.
